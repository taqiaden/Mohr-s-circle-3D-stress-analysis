# Mohr-s-circle-3D-stress-analysis
Draw Mohr's circle for 2D and 3D stress conditions and compute the principle stress with the associated angles of each principle stress

This Project has been developed by Taqiaden Alshameri as an assignment during his undergraduate studies. The tool is programmed based on VB language with straightforward instructions. The result of the code has been varified through several examples of stress analysis.
